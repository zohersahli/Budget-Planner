   npm test
   ```

---

## ðŸ§ª Testing

- **Framework**: Vitest with happy-dom
- **Test File**: `budgetMath.test.js`
- **Coverage**: Core calculations and edge cases
- **Approach**: Test-Driven Development (TDD)

### How Tests Work

The test suite validates two core mathematical functions:

#### 1. `calculateRemaining(income, expenses)`
Tests the remaining balance calculation:
- âœ… **Normal cases**: Positive income and expenses
- âœ… **Zero expenses**: When no expenses are recorded
- âœ… **Overspending**: When expenses exceed income
- âœ… **Edge cases**: Zero income, negative values

#### 2. `calculateSavingPercentage(income, expenses)`
Tests the savings percentage calculation:
- âœ… **Positive savings**: When income > expenses
- âœ… **Zero savings**: When income = expenses  
- âœ… **Negative savings**: When expenses > income
- âœ… **Rounding accuracy**: Proper decimal handling

### Running Tests

```bash
npm install    # Install dependencies
npm test       # Run all tests
```

## Future Enhancements

- Cloud synchronization
- Multiple currency support
- Data export/import
- Advanced analytics and charts
